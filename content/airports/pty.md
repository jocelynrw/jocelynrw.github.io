Panama City Airport is going under some construction. If you are having a transfer there, and need to get from Terminal 1 to 2--be ready to run! It's a long way away from one end to the other. Generally, it's in a "U"-ish shape. Some of Terminal 2 windows face inward towards Terminal 1.

Also--there are very few places to eat there, even though there are a lot of shops. Above the middle part of Terminal 1 there is a food court--when I was there, it was very crowded. I got my food and left to go eat outside of my gate in Terminal 2.  The only other major issue I had here was that, since I was coming back to the US, I forget/didn't realize that I would need to go through ANOTHER security check right by my gate entry! Had to remove shoes and all. Just something to be ready for if you're on a layover back to the US!
